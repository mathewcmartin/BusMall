Roles:
  -Marketing Research Team
  -Developers
  -Focus Group

1. Marketing Team Member: As a member of the marketing team, Dan wants to know which of the images will most appeal to the general public and more specifically those individuals interested in purchasing BusMall's products. Creating engaging and interesting visuals will be key to this goal and determining what images are selected is important to good analysis. Will the images sell?

2. Marketing Team Lead: As the marketing team lead, Laura knows that in order to be successful, BusMall must keep production and marketing expenses in check. It is very important that time and materials are not wasted on unproductive and misguided use of information. Creating a solid process for determining what is going to work ahead of time will save time and money producing a better quality and more effective product in the end.

3. Developer: As the lead developer with BusMall, David is determined to use concise code that will be easily maintainable and provide both value and utility to BusMall's goals as a service provider. Working for a start-up provides plenty of wiggle room to be creative while having a small dev team provides a ton of flexibility but little established guidelines. This is a double edged sword, yet, David is pumped to jump right in and brand BusMall as the marketing juggernaut of the future.

4. Focus Group Member: As a focus group member, Loni has a clear opinion of what she likes and does not like. Quick to point out issues with the visual symmetry and general aesthetics of a website, she is unadulterated in her criticism of what she finds displeasing to the eye.

5. Focus Group Lead: As the focus group lead, Don struggles to keep his opinionated team on point with respect to what works and what doesn't. With a group of eight unique perspectives all wanting to be heard, just holding down the fort is challenging in itself. Seemingly, herding cats at times, Don is a master at tactfully driving the discussion back to the issues at hand. Giving BusMall the best possible chance at generating useful quantifiable data that can be analyzed and extrapolated into a powerful tool for success.
